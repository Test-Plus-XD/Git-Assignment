SDLC phases reflection:
I have no opinion on Git or GitHub. For me, SDLC has seen little improvement since I mainly work alone.
Version rollback reflection:
Version control and rollback are highly useful, especially for debugging.
Team collaboration reflection:
As I currently work solo, Gitâ€™s collaboration features hold no relevance for me at this stage.
