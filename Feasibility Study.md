# Feasibility Study Template

**Project Aspect:** Full-stack restaurant‚Äêguide + reviews/reservations web application (modeled on OpenRice)

## Technical Feasibility

**Available Technology:**

- Front-end: React / Angular; responsive HTML/CSS  
- Back-end: Node.js/Express; REST APIs  
- Database: Firebase or try MongoDB
- Supporting tools: OAuth authentication, image storage, mapping/geolocation APIs, version control (Git), deployment platforms (student/cloud tiers)

- Required skills: JavaScripts, back-end development, database design, API design, deployment/devops fundamentals, UI/UX, responsive design

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

- Hardware: PC with sufficient RAM and storage to run dev servers  
- Software: IDE, local server environment, database server (local or cloud)  
- Network: Internet access for APIs
- Cloud/internet services: hosting domain + SSL, storage for media, CDN as needed

**Assessment:** Conditional Feasible  
**Reasoning:** The technology stack and skills largely align; success depends on limiting feature scope and efficient time management over one year, __especially whether my part-time job can cover the school and third-party services fee__.

## Economic Feasibility

**Costs:**

- Hosting, domain registration, SSL, cloud storage  
- Possible AI, paid API subscriptions or premium tools  
- Significant investment of time for development, learning, testing

**Benefits:**

- Substantial learning in full-stack development and deployment  
- Project suitable for portfolio / academic demonstration  

**ROI Analysis:**

- Monetary cost is low if using free/student tiers, but most provider don't have free tier ; time cost high but compensated by educational value  
- Benefit (skills acquired, demonstrable product) exceeds projected financial cost

**Assessment:** Conditional Feasible
**Reasoning:** Educational returns and portfolio value __might__ justify the costs.

## Organizational Feasibility

**Team Capabilities:**

- _No team so far._

**Legal/Compliance:**

- Must address data protection (user data, reviews), image copyright/ownership  (May use AI media for testing)
- Terms of service, privacy policy required; local/regional legal obligations for user data

**Cultural Fit:**

- Fits well with student learning culture; aligns with development practice and independent/project-based work  
- Solo work has limitations for feedback, peer review, but acceptable at current stage

**Assessment:** Feasible  
**Reasoning:** With attention to skill gaps and compliance, project fits the academic context.

## Risks

**Technical Risks:**

- Over-ambition leading to delayed or incomplete features  
- Integration difficulties (mapping, media, external APIs)  
- Security vulnerabilities; performance issues as user/media volume grows  

**Economic Risks:**

- Unanticipated fees for APIs, hosting, domain renewals  
- Under-estimating time; possible schedule overruns  

**Organizational Risks:**

- Gaps in skill causing bottlenecks  
- Loss of motivation or external constraints (other coursework)

## Recommendation

**Overall Assessment:** Conditional Feasible, __the outcome is determined by the timing of progression to complete organ(_liver_) failure of my body__.

**Key Conditions:**

- Define and adhere to a minimal viable product (MVP) list  
- Use free/student tiers / open-source tools where possible  
- Incorporate security, privacy, and compliance measures early  

**Next Steps:**

- Finalise feature list for MVP  
- Select tech stack and set up development environment + version control structure  
- Draft privacy policy / terms of service based on local regulations  
- Plan project timeline (monthly goals: front-end, back-end, integration, deployment, testing)
